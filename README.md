# A* Path Finding Algorithm Visualization

A Python application that visually demonstrates the A* pathfinding algorithm. This project allows you to choose your start and end locations and visualize the process of finding the shortest path.

## Overview

This visualization tool is built to showcase the A* pathfinding algorithm. It provides an interactive interface to pick the start and end locations and observe the algorithm in action, highlighting the shortest path.

## Features

- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm:** Utilizes the A* algorithm for efficient pathfinding.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Allows users to pick start and end locations and observe the algorithm's process.
- **Graphical Representation:** Provides a visual representation of the grid, obstacles, and the shortest path.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sukhbir77/a-star-algorithm-visualizer-tool-python.git
